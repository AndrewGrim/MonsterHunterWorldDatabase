# Changelog

## v1.0 2019-11-05

The first publicly available version has been released.

## v1.1 2019-11-07

* Added a window for searching globally across all information. When double clicking on an item it will take you to its relevant page. Press enter to begin search.

* Added new setting to keep the new search window open after double clicking on an item.

* Consolidated all item images in an items folder instead of storing them separately ie ammo, coatings, materials.

## v1.2 2019-11-08

* Changed all remaining trees to my custom grid. This results in a faster load time but mainly is just nicer to work with.

* Because of the above, the setting "Auto expand materials" has been removed since it no longer applies.

## v1.2.5 2019-11-10

* Added a loading bar when starting the application.

* Changed equipment images to jpges and removed unused monster pngs. Resulting in a zip size about one third of the previous version.
